	Aloha AC!
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Teal Hoopii, and I am running for the Director of Human resources position for the Spring 2016 semester. I am currently in my senior year, pursuing a degree in both Accounting & Management. This semester makes my third semester in Accounting Club and second semester as an active member. I also had the wonderful opportunity of being on the board this semester as the Director of Information Systems. Being apart of the board and being able to devote my time and efforts to you all, gave me a greater appreciate for this club and what it offers. I was able to grow personally, socially, emotionally and professionally.

	My current position on board, which also serves as my first semester on board, as Director of Information Systems, helped me get a better sense of the what the club is about, how my time and commitment really impacts the club, and how my time and efforts benefit the members in a positive way. My position required me to continuously update the events calendar, which showed that I was always on top of my duties, and kept up with changes throughout the semester. I was also responsible for putting together the ledger that was sent out every month. This specific duty proved my ability to set deadlines for the board members to send in their ledger entry, and also set deadlines for myself to send out the ledger in a timely manner. This duty also allowed me to show my artistic skills by creating an appealing ledger to read. As Director of Information Systems, I was also responsible for taking pictures at the AC events. This task gave me the opportunity to take initiative of gathering people to smile for the camera, and capturing action shots throughout the events. Last but not least, I had an amazing opportunity to design and create the club t-shirt for this semesters Super Clubs Day. This gave me an opportunity to again, show off my artistic skills, and provide a t-shirt that would represent Accounting Club, well.

	Next semester I plan to take 15 credits, which has always been a reasonable amount of credits for me to accomplish throughout my college career. This will allow me to balance school along with dedicating my time to Accounting Club. I will also only be working part-time (15-20 hours), which I currently do this semester, which still gives me a lot of valuable time to offer to AC. I believe that being able to balance more than just one task, is a very valuable skill to being a board member and I believe these skills will make me a great candidate as Director of Human Resources for the Spring 2016 semester.
