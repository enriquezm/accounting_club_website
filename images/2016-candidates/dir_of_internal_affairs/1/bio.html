	Hello Accounting Club! My name is Michelle Tellio and Iâ€™m running for your Director of Internal Affairs. Currently, I am a junior majoring in accounting and minoring in French. This is my second semester in the club which I have been active in for both semesters. Being in the club has made me grow as a person both professionally and personally. It has been a great experience that I have shared with some of the most amazing people. As a board member, I am willing to go the extra mile to help members have the best experience in the club.

	<p>
	In my experience, I have been able to cultivate skills which helped me prepare for this position. Currently, I help with the fundraising events for French Club on campus. I help my advisor plan out events to make sure there will be enough food to be sold and reach our goal to make money. I am also a part of the Manoa Lions Club which has taught me hard work and dedication through community service. With my responsibilities of school, work, and extra-curricular activities, I learned time management and to work hard in everything that I do. These skills will help me as a board member to fulfill all of my duties.

	<p>
	Next semester, I will be taking only 15 credits with an on campus job, so I am flexible for any responsibilities that Accounting Club might have. I know that being on board will take a lot of my time and I have to learn a lot of new am willing to put as much time needed to make next semester a great one.
