	Hi Everyone!
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Jared Maron and I am running for the IBC Senator Position. I am currently a Sophomore studying Accounting and Economics. This is my first semester in Accounting Club and I am really enjoying my time. There have been so many people that I have met and friends that I have made, who I am able to recognize and say hello to as I am walking throughout campus. Becoming a part of the Accounting Club has provided me with a people I can call my second family. There is so much to learn and be a part of, so I believe that becoming the IBC Senator will help me to get a feel for a lot more of what Accounting Club is about, as well as the Executive Board. As an entry level position for the Executive Board, this position can help me progress through Board positions and do more for the Club as well as help me to become friends with a lot more of the people. I have always been able to meet deadlines and multi-task, but receiving the IBC Senator position can help me to strengthen these points of mine and also increase other skills that will help me on the Executive Board.
