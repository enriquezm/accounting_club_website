	Hi everyone!
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Kristi Kataoka and I am running to be your next Director of Information Systems. I am currently a Junior planning to major in Finance and International Business. This is my fourth semester as a member of Accounting Club and have continued to enjoy every experience of it. Although I am not an Accounting major, AC has given me an invaluable experience. Not only have I learned more about Accounting itself, but also how professionalism is held in this career. Being in AC has also allowed me to expand my network of not only professionals, but also friendships. I met so many amazing people through joining AC and I really care about everyone in the club, which is why I want to start giving back.

	When it comes to Information Systems, I would say my skills are quite proficient. I currently work part-time in the Information and Computer Science (ICS) Department on campus as an Assistant Computer Technician. I do a variety of things such as install and maintain both hardware and software in computers as well as develop the software system used the ICS computer labs. These skills will allow me to further improve the AC website, calendar, and monthly ledger if elected. This semester, I also happen to be an Assisting Teaching Assistant (ATA) for the ICS 101B course. Therefore, I am proficient in using the main Microsoft Office programs, such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, along with Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I assist several students with said programs throughout the course both in the lab section as well as during open lab hours. Both working and being an ATA has allowed me to work with a variety of people, including students, faculty, and staff, and it has given me the experience of assisting and teaching. So, if you ever have any questions about computers or computer programs, feel free to ask me.

	Next semester I am planning to take 12 credits, which will be the least amount of credits I will be taking since starting at UH. Three of the four courses I am planning to take will be stacked on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which will allow me ample time to dedicate to the position and to Accounting Club. Those said classes will not interfere with the Thursday general meeting days. Although I am still working, my job, as mentioned earlier, is on campus and my hours are very flexible. While it may seem like I am very busy, I am very organized and manage my schedule accordingly. I would not take on more than I would be able to handle, especially when it comes to a job like this that requires much commitment. With my skills and experience, I have learned how to work with many different people, with different majors, and different personalities, as well as many different computers and their software and hardware. Thus, I feel that I am worthy of your vote as a candidate for your next Director of Information Systems.
