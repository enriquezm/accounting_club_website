	Hey AC!
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Cullen Cheng and I am running for the position of Director of Information Systems.  I am currently a Sophomore studying Accounting and considering a double major in Management Information Systems.  I have been an active member in Accounting Club for 3 semesters. For the semesters, I have dedicated to the club, I have learned a lot about the members and goals of AC.  AC has helped me expand my horizons on my intrapersonal and interpersonal skills from communicating with the members and professionals.  I want to strengthen the bond in AC and I believe being on board will allow me to accomplish this goal.  It is in my best interest to help maintain a peaceful and cheerful atmosphere for my fellow members.

	I plan to take 16 credits with one online course and find a flexible campus job for next semester, so I will still have time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities as a board member.  Being a part of ACâ€™s Video Committee and Aloha Banquet IT Committee has deepened my understanding and provided experience for some of the skills such as developing the script, translating the script to a storyboard, editing video clips, and basic HTML/CSS programming skills beneficial for this position. Along with an aspiring interest in technology, I believe I am a potential candidate to be your next Director of Information Systems of Spring 2016.
