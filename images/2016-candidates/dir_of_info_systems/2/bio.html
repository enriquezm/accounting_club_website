	Greetings everyone!
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Christopher Moon, and I hope to be your new Director of Information Systems this Spring 2016!  As a junior pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Accounting, I can understand the dense course material that many of you face and the focus required to overcome such rigorous intellectual and situational obstacles.  As Director of Information Systems, I vow to use my tenacious approach to problem solving to serve all of your technical and resource-related needs.

	As a hobby-time photographer/social media user, I have five years’ experience using an SLR and have captured photographs across many different cultures, presenting them in both an artistic and thoughtful manner.  Most importantly, I enjoy “capturing the moments” that make an event special, and wish to do the same as AC’s photographer! Also, as the previous Operations Coordinator of a small leadership group called Summit, I have experience planning and executing key events that promoted the vision and direction of a fledgling organization.  
	While I believe that my existing skill set will be of great benefit to AC, I am always eager to tackle new challenges and acquire additional skills that will further advance the club.    
	</p>

	Since joining AC this past semester, my experience has been tremendously positive.  Sharing interests and majors with many of you has made AC feel so familiar and welcoming.  Despite only one semester with you all, I feel as if I have known you my entire life! Cherishing the experiences from this past semester, I look forward to many more with you in the next.  Please allow me to serve on the executive board as a way to give back to this fine community and create an even better experience for future AC members!

	Warmest regards,
	</p>

	Christopher C. Moon
