	Hi AC!
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Matthew Lizada and I am running to be your next Director of Professional Development. I am a Senior majoring in Accounting and have been in the club for 7 semesters. I have been a part of this club’s development and witnessed the changes over the past three and a half years and want to do the best I can to further the growth of the club. AC has become an integral part of my life and my second family. With the amount of experience and knowledge I have gained through and about the club, I believe I am an excellent candidate for the Director of Professional Development.

	This semester, I am currently serving as the Director of Public Relations. The Director of Public Relations coordinates the community service events as well as strengthen relationships within the community at large (and the club) by encouraging member’s participation and involvement. The position requires a lot of dedication and has helped to develop the communication skills and teamwork necessary for the Director of Professional Development. With the knowledge and experience I have gained from coordinating 8 successful community service activities, I am confident that I have the necessary skills to plan and facilitate professional development events.

	The Fall 2015 semester is coming to an end, so keep up the good work and I hope to see you all on November 19th!

	Matt
