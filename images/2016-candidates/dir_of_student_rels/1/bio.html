	Dear AC Family, 
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Heather Hutchison and I will be running for the position of Director of Student Relations. I am a senior graduating next semester with my bachelors of Accounting and International Business. I have been in AC for three semesters, the last two being active. After being in AC for so long and getting so much out of the club, I feel like it is time to give back. In what better way to give back than with which events I love the most! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Next semester I will only be taking three classes, along with working part time. I have already been able to balance two clubs, four committees, work, and a full class load this semester and I am positive that I will be able to do it again next semester. I will be working less at my job with the help of a student loan, which gives me more time to dedicate to the club. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I plan on making socials for all ranges of people, from a sophisticated night at the Amuse Wine bar, an adventurous geocaching hike, a sports themed Super Bowl party, to a lei making worship to help make homemade leis for our graduating Seniors. I also want to make team bonding socials to help everyone get to know one another and meet people they have never seen before. By encourage people to get out of their comfort zones while building club spirit I believe this club with become more welcoming to everyone. As an added bonus, I will be baking a themed homemade desserts for each social event. Please vote for me for Director of Student Relations and I will do my best to make sure that Spring 2016 is a semester to remember.
