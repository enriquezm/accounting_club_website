	Hi AC,
	</p>
	<p>
	My name is Troy Uchida and I am running for the position of Director of Student Relations. I am currently a Junior studying for my degree in Accounting. I’ve been an active member of the Accounting Club for the past 2 semesters and have held the position of Inter Business Council Senator during the previous semester. I see the Accounting Club as my home away from home, where I’ve built everlasting friendships that will carry on long after I graduate and well into my professional career. During my time here I have witnessed the club prosper under great leadership and believe that with my experience on board I can contribute to this positive growth once again.

	My first position on board as the IBC senator gave me insight into my own personal development. During events like Super Clubs day I had to be able to clearly communicate my goals to fellow senators while not offending anyone in the process.  Coordinating events like Meet the Pros Accounting Mixer gave me the tools to plan a major AC event and effectively converse with professionals. These events have all enforced teamwork and communications skills that I believe are key to a successful board member. While on board I also worked at my part-time for Armstong Produce, instilling time management skills that I utilize to this day. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My main goal if elected will be to break down the silos of cliques within the club. I want every member to be able to approach each other in the hallways of Shilder and greet each other with a smile and a wave as if there are no awkwardness between them. Through events like Camp, Team Bonding, and Other Socials I believe that this is an attainable goal. I believe that I am a candidate worthy of your vote for Director of Student Relations for Spring 2015.

	Thank you, 
	</p>

	Troy Uchida
