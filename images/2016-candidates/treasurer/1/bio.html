	Hey AC! My name is Andrew Tam, and I am running to be your next Treasurer. As of right now, I am a Junior double majoring in Accounting and Management. I have been active in Accounting Club for five semesters, and through these semesters I have gotten to know a lot of people and have seen how the club works.

	I believe being on board this semester will qualify me as the next Treasurer. This semester being the Director of Internal Affairs, I was able to work closely with the current Treasurer, it gave me the opportunity to learn how and where the position stands in the club. In this position, I was able to run one mandatory event, Car Wash and one of the larger social events, Club Night. In addition to these events, I also handle the fundraisers and providing food for the GMâ€™s. My experiences in this position has taught me a lot on how to be a better leader, manage my time, and handle finances especially for fundraisers and the food. I think this is something that I can translate it into the Treasurer position and also provide guidance for the next Director of Internal Affairs.

	Next semester, I will be taking 15 credits similar to what I did this semester. I have a part-time job on campus, so I feel that my schedule will be flexible enough to be able to dedicate my time to the club. I recognize the challenges and responsibilities that the Treasurer faces, but I believe that I will be able to overcome them. I am confident that I can fulfill the duties that are required and to go beyond it. I hope to give back as your next Treasurer.
