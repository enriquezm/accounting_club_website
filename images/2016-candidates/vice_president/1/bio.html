	Hi AC! My name is YeeYan and I am running to be your next Vice President. Currently, I am a junior double majoring in Accounting and Management. This is my fifth semester in Accounting Club and I have been active in all of the semesters. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I believe my past leadership positions will qualify me as the Vice President. Last semester as the Director of Professional Relations, I successfully coordinated 25 professional events while assisting other board members with their duties. Also, as last fall’s Director of Public Relations, I coordinated nine community service events, all of which were successful and organized. As the former Director of Public Relations and Director of Professional Relations, I have had a lot of interactions with general members. If elected, I believe I can offer my knowledge and experience to members and easily approach and guide them if necessary.

	Next semester, I will be taking 15 credits as well as working an on-campus job. I will be taking two accounting classes and just like the past semesters, I will be able to devote my time and effort to the club.  I understand the responsibilities and hardships that the Vice President will be facing, however, I believe that I will be able to overcome all obstacles and oversee the club, its members, and the executive board. From my past leadership experiences and my dedication to Accounting Club, I hope to give back to the club as your next Vice President.
