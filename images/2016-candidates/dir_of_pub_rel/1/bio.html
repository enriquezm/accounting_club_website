	Hello Accounting Club! My name is Royce Yamamoto and I am running for the Executive Board position of Public Relations. I am currently a Junior majoring in Pre-Business as I will declare my major as Accounting next semester and this is my second semester in Accounting Club. I believe that through this semester, the events, and the people give me great confidence in running for a position for the upcoming semester.
	</p>
	<p>
	Being in the club has given me a lot of opportunities to grow personally and professionally. I have gotten to meet a lot of great people from joining and believe that I could help members experience the same thing too. The club has given me so much that I feel that this is my chance to give back. Being on board would give me an opportunity to teach, help, and learn from members throughout the club.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next semester I will be taking 15 credits with an on-campus part-time job. In past semesters I have taken 15 credits with two-part time jobs, which I feel have prepared me to be able to put a lot of time into the Executive Board position and also into meeting each and every one of you individually better.Â
